# Contributing to Furigana for Spotify

Thanks for helping make Japanese lyrics easier to read.

## Before opening an issue

- Check the existing issues first.
- Confirm that Spotify, Spicetify, and Furigana for Spotify are up to date.
- Do not paste complete song lyrics, account details, access tokens, or other private data.

Compatibility reports are most useful when they include:

- operating system and version
- Spotify version and installation source
- Spicetify version
- Furigana for Spotify version
- Normal or fullscreen lyrics view
- A short, redacted console error or screenshot

## Development

Requirements: Node.js 22 or later and npm.

Read the [development guide](./docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for the architecture, repository layout, source-build installation, and verification boundaries.

```sh
npm ci
npm run check
```

Release packaging currently runs on Windows through `npm run package`; runtime and installer checks run on Windows, macOS, and Linux in CI.

Keep changes focused. Add or update tests when changing lyric selectors, text handling, the reading engine, or generated DOM behavior.

## Pull requests

1. Explain the user-visible reason for the change.
2. Keep unrelated refactors out of the same pull request.
3. Run `npm run check` before submitting.
4. Include screenshots for visible UI changes.
