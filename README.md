The extension enhances lyrics already displayed by Spotify and uses standard HTML `<ruby>` annotations to place readings above kanji.

| Original lyric | With furigana |
| --- | --- |
| 声も聞かさないで | <ruby>声<rt>こえ</rt></ruby>も<ruby>聞<rt>き</rt></ruby>かさないで |
| 明日は晴れる | <ruby>明日<rt>あした</rt></ruby>は<ruby>晴<rt>は</rt></ruby>れる |

## Why use it

- **Works with Spotify's lyrics view**: automatically processes the current desktop layout and known fullscreen lyrics layouts.
- **Local by default**: Kuroshiro + Kuromoji perform tokenization and reading conversion on your machine without contacting a lyrics service.
- **Optional accurate-reading mode**: use synchronized romanization when available to handle readings such as `二人` → `ふたり` and intentional lyric pronunciations.
- **Choose how readings appear**: switch between hiragana, katakana, and romaji, then tune size, opacity, and vertical spacing.
- **Keeps Spotify's lyrics view**: it enhances the text already visible in Spotify instead of replacing the player or its timing.
- **Easy to toggle**: use the lyrics button in the player bar or the custom app page in the sidebar.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11, or macOS 12 or later
- Spotify Desktop: on Windows, use the [spotify.com build](https://www.spotify.com/download/windows/) or Microsoft Store build (install only one); on macOS, use the [spotify.com build](https://www.spotify.com/download/mac/)
- [Spicetify](https://spicetify.app/docs/getting-started)

Verified on real hardware with:

| Component | Verified version |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | Windows 11 Pro 10.0.26200 |
| Spotify | Microsoft Store build 1.2.96.518 |
| Spicetify | 2.44.0 |

Other versions may work, but have not been individually verified.

The macOS installer and production bundle are covered by automated checks on macOS runners. A real Spotify client compatibility report has not yet been recorded, so macOS support should be considered newly available rather than real-client verified.

See the [compatibility matrix](./docs/COMPATIBILITY.md) for more version information.

## Install

<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/huiishan99/spotify-furigana/releases/latest"><img alt="Download the latest release" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-latest%20release-00A77D?style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=github" /></a>
</p>

Download `spotify-furigana-vX.Y.Z.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/huiishan99/spotify-furigana/releases/latest), then extract it completely.

### Windows

Open PowerShell in the extracted folder and run:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1
```

The installer detects your single Spotify installation, backs up an existing Furigana installation, installs and enables the app, applies the Spicetify configuration, and creates a **Furigana for Spotify** launcher in the Start menu. The launcher uses the project's original **ふ** icon so it is easy to distinguish from Spotify's regular shortcut.

After installation, open **Furigana for Spotify** from the Start menu. This launcher checks and reapplies Spicetify before opening Spotify, so the extension survives normal restarts and can recover automatically after supported Spotify updates. Play a Japanese song with lyrics and open the lyrics view; the local dictionary may take a moment to load on the first conversion.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft Store users must launch **Furigana for Spotify** instead of Spotify's regular shortcut. The generated launcher runs `spicetify auto` with the required app directory; opening the Store app directly will show the unmodified Spotify UI. Spicetify 2.44 officially lists support through Spotify 1.2.93; the Store 1.2.96 setup above is real-client tested by this project but remains outside Spicetify's official range.

### macOS

Open Terminal in the extracted folder and run:

```sh
sh ./install.sh
```

The installer supports Spotify in `/Applications` or `~/Applications`, validates Spotify's preferences, backs up an existing Furigana installation, configures and applies Spicetify, and creates **Furigana for Spotify.app** in `~/Applications` with the project's **ふ** icon. Open this launcher for future starts so `spicetify auto` can repair supported Spotify updates before launching Spotify.

## Update

Download and extract the newest Release ZIP, then run its installer again:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1
```

On macOS:

```sh
sh ./install.sh
```

The installer preserves the previous installation as a timestamped backup before updating it.

## Customize the readings

Open **Furigana for Spotify** from Spotify's sidebar. The settings page lets you:

- switch between hiragana, katakana, and romaji readings;
- adjust reading size from 30% to 75%;
- adjust opacity from 40% to 100%;
- add up to 8 px of vertical spacing;
- restore the display defaults with one click.
- enable experimental online accurate readings and clear their local cache.

Changes are saved locally and apply immediately.

## Optional accurate readings and privacy

Online accurate readings are **off by default**. When enabled, the extension sends the current public track title and artist to the GD Studio search endpoint, then requests the selected track's synchronized lyrics and romanization from NetEase Cloud Music. The Spotify album name is used only for local result ranking. It uses that pronunciation data only to annotate the matching Spotify lyric line.

The extension does not send Spotify credentials, cookies, account data, or the lyrics rendered by Spotify. Successful matches are cached locally for up to 30 days; unavailable matches are remembered for 6 hours to avoid repeated requests, with at most 30 tracks retained. The settings page can clear this cache at any time. Provider availability and song coverage are not guaranteed, so the local dictionary remains the automatic fallback.

## Uninstall

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\uninstall.ps1
```

On macOS:

```sh
sh ./uninstall.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

- **No Furigana page in the sidebar:** run `spicetify apply`, then restart Spotify.
- **The button appears but lyrics are unchanged:** make sure the song has Japanese lyrics containing kanji, enable the lyrics button, and wait briefly for the first local dictionary load.
- **Online accurate readings stay on the local fallback:** the provider may not have synchronized romanization, the album/version may not match safely, or the service may be temporarily unavailable. The extension deliberately refuses weak matches.
- **The app disappeared after a Spotify update:** close Spotify and open **Furigana for Spotify** from the Windows Start menu or `~/Applications` on macOS. If needed, run `spicetify backup apply` once.
- **The installer detects two Spotify installations:** keep either the Microsoft Store build or the [spotify.com build](https://www.spotify.com/download/windows/), remove the other, open the retained app for at least 60 seconds, then run the installer again.
- **Microsoft Store Spotify opens without Furigana:** close it and use **Furigana for Spotify** from the Start menu; do not use the regular Store shortcut.
- **macOS says Spotify or its preferences are missing:** install Spotify in `/Applications` or `~/Applications`, open it, sign in for at least 60 seconds, close it, and rerun `sh ./install.sh`.
- **The macOS launcher cannot find Spicetify:** reinstall Spicetify, open a new Terminal window, and rerun the Furigana installer so the launcher is rebuilt.

## Known limitations

- Local mode can misread names, place names, wordplay, and intentionally unusual pronunciations. Online accurate readings improve supported songs but cannot cover every track or line.
- Spotify updates can change the lyrics DOM. If the extension stops working, include your Spotify and Spicetify versions in the issue.
- Web Player and mobile are not supported. macOS has automated installer/build coverage but is awaiting a published real-client verification report.
